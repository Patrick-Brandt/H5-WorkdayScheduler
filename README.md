# H5-Workday Scheduler
This is my 5th homework assignment for the University of Washington Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp. The assignment was to create a workday scheduler using Moment.js.

## Acceptance Criteria for Assignment:

- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
- THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).
- WHEN I click into a time block
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that time block
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist

## Languages/Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Moment.js

## Website Images
This is the main image of the website. The current date and time are shown at the top, with the seconds changing. The user is able to type in the text area next to each time block, and save each entry by clicking the save button on the right. 
![This is the main page of my Daily Sceduler Website](https://github.com/Patrick-Brandt/H5-WorkdayScheduler/blob/main/Assets/dailyScheduler.png?raw=true)
This image shows the color-change functionality. Gray indicates that the time block is in the past, red indicates the present time block, and green indicates that the time block is in the future.

The user can type in the text area, and save by clicking the button on the right. Contents of text area will be saved to local storage when the user clicks the save button on the right.
In addition, the text will remain after refreshing the page.

* At the time that I made this website, I hadn't even been coding for two months. I found the project to be very challenging, and I learned a great deal in the process! While this was a solo project, part of the HTML and CSS were provided to me by the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp, although I did make changes to each. I was not provided with any starter code for the Javascript or jQuery. That was all me!
